## Rapid Yagura Shogi - Valorant Edition

Shogi is a Japanese form of what is commonly described as Chess. Both Chess and Shogi share a common ancestor, which was an Indian game known as Chaturanga. 

In Shogi, Yagura is a term used to describe a "castle" or a "fortress", while its direct Japanese translation could also mean something such as "tower" or "keep". I call this Rapid Yagura Shogi because it inherits an idea in Chess called "castling", which slides the king behind a rook in one move. In Shogi, castles are much more complicated and require knowledge of different attacks and traps.

## Releases

The game is nowhere near completion, and I'm still in the testing/debugging phase of the raw game before I move onto implementing more advanced features.
But I'll upload pre-releases so you can check out how the game's progress is doing for your own entertainment, or to help me finish this project.
You can find my releases [here](https://github.com/DonYall/rapid-yagura/releases)
Make sure you have [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or newer installed on your system before running the Jar file.
